# Deployer #

A small and simple script to help you install stuff on a server.

It isn't Debian packaging. It isn't Docker. It's really just to help me, a little bit.

## Packages #

```
sudo apt-get install      \
  libmodern-perl-perl     \
  libconfig-simple-perl   \
  libfile-slurp-perl      \
  libipc-run3-perl        \
  libjson-any-perl
```

(Ends)
